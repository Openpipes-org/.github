## What's is Open Pipes?

Open Pipes is a project that allows to build a complete open-source virtual pipe organ (VPO).

## Our mission

We want to get an alternative to democratize the access to once-exclusive, closed-source and very expensive instrument with a set of open-source hardware and software solutions.

## Resouces ## 

Linux-embedded distro (Pipebian): based on Raspberry OS, is a Virtual Pipe Organ with a low latency audio engine. With Pipebian the user can build their own powerful music workstation with a VPO open-source software like GrandOrgue.

Main Organ PCB Controller: an Arduino-compatible based (Pro Micro) organ control circuit with a custom code to manage a whole set of MIDI PCBs Peripherals Organ Console with one circuit.

PCB Peripherals Organ Console (connected to Main Organ PCB Controller): a set of MIDI button PCBs specifically to the type used by commercial electronic / Virtual Pipe Organs, like rocker buttons, preset thumb knobs, foot pistons, analog slicers, etc. 

3d-printed knob controllers: plastic printable 3D parts (buttons, preset thumb knobs, slicers etc.) that can be directly screwed over the PCB Peripherals Organ Console without requiring advanced woodworking skills.

MIDI Pedalboard circuit: plans and Arduino code to build your full 32-note MIDI  Pedalboard circuit, functioning as a standard peripheral for the whole ecosystem.

Complete organ wood console plans, with assembly instructions, allowing enthusiasts to build their own organ consoles. They are optimized to be easily assembled directly from the cut shop, from the provided cut list.
