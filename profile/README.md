## What is Open Pipes?

Open Pipes is a project that allows you to build a complete open-source virtual pipe organ (VPO) workstation system.

## Our mission

We want to get an alternative to democratize the access to once-exclusive, closed-source and very expensive instrument with a set of open-source hardware and software solutions.

## Projects

### Linux-embedded distro

Pipebian64 is a optimized and low latency audio engine distro for Raspberry Pi4 B. With Pipebian64 the user can build their own powerful music workstation with a VPO open-source software like GrandOrgue.

### Main MIDI Controller Board

An Arduino-compatible based (Pro Micro) board with a custom code to manage a whole set of MIDI Peripherals Organ Console boards with one circuit.
