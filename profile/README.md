## What is Open Pipes?

Open Pipes is a project that allows you to build a complete open-source virtual pipe organ (VPO) workstation system.

## Our mission

We want to get an alternative to democratize the access to once-exclusive, closed-source and very expensive instrument with a set of open-source hardware and software solutions.

## Projects

### Linux-embedded distro

Pipebian64 is a optimized and low latency audio engine distro for Raspberry Pi4 B. With Pipebian64 the user can build their own powerful music workstation with a VPO open-source software like GrandOrgue.

### Main MIDI Controller Board

An Arduino-compatible based (Pro Micro) board with a custom code to manage a whole set of MIDI PCBs Peripherals Organ Console with one circuit.

### PCB Peripherals Organ Console

A set of MIDI button PCBs to connect to Main MIDI Controller Board, specifically to the type used by commercial electronic / Virtual Pipe Organs console, like:
* [Rocker buttons PCB](https://github.com/Openpipes-org/Rocker_buttons_PCB)
* [Thumbs buttons PCB](https://github.com/Openpipes-org/Thumbs_buttons_PCB)
* Foot pistons
* Volume pedal
* Analog slicers, etc. 

### 3D-printed knob controllers and parts

Plastic-printable 3D parts to fix over the PCB Peripherals Organ Console, like:
* [Rocker buttons 3D-parts](https://github.com/Openpipes-org/Rocker_buttons_3D_parts)
* [Thumbs buttons 3D-parts](https://github.com/Openpipes-org/Thumbs_buttons_3D_parts)
* Foot piston
* Analog slicers, ecc

### MIDIfy Keyboards and Pedalboard

* PCB project to transform your analogic keyboard in a fully functional MIDI keyboard
* Plans and Arduino code to build your full 32-note MIDI pedalboard PCB

### Complete organ wood console

Plans with assembly instructions, allowing to build their own organ console. They are optimized to be easily assembled directly from the cut shop, from the provided cut list.
